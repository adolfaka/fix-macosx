        <h2>How to restore privacy:</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Disable "Spotlight Suggestions" and "Bing Web Searches" in
              System Preferences &gt; Spotlight &gt; Search Results.</li>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Safari <em>also</em> has a "Spotlight Suggestions" setting that is seperate from
              Spotlight's "Spotlight Suggestions". This uses the same mechanism as Spotlight, and
              if left enabled, Safari will send a copy of all search queries to Apple.
            </p>
            <p>
              You'd be forgiven for thinking that you'd already disabled "Spotlight Suggestions", but
              you'll also need to uncheck "Include Spotlight Suggestions" in Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Search.
            </p>

            Spotlight isn't the only Mac OS X Yosemite feature that unnecessarily phones home;
            a myriad of system and user processes are sending data to Apple in a default configuration,
            and we want to fix those, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/fix-macosx/yosemite-phone-home">Yosemite Phone Home</a> is a collaborative
            project to identify additional data that collected by Apple and other third parties. This
            work is powered by <a href="https://github.com/fix-macosx/net-monitor">Net-Monitor</a>, our open-source toolkit
            for auditing phone home behavior system-wide.

        <h2>Why do we need this?</h2>
        <p>
          If you've upgraded to Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10) and you're using the default settings, each time you start
          typing in Spotlight (to open an application or search for a file on your computer),
	  your local search terms and location are <a href="assets/img/spotlight_terms.png">sent to Apple and third parties</a>
          (including Microsoft).
        </p>
        <p>
          Mac OS X has always respected user privacy by default, and Mac OS X Yosemite should too. Since it
          doesn't, you can use the code to the left to disable the parts of Mac OS X which are invasive to
          your privacy.
